Microsoft Entra Verified ID is a decentralized identity solution that helps you safeguard your organization. The service allows you to issue and verify credentials. Issuers can use the Verified ID service to issue their own customized verifiable credentials. Verifiers can use the service's free REST API to easily request and accept verifiable credentials in apps and services. In both cases, your Azure AD tenant needs to be configured to either issue your own verifiable credentials, or verify the presentation of a user's verifiable credentials issued by a third party. In the event that you are both an issuer and a verifier, you can use a single Azure AD tenant to both issue your own verifiable credentials and verify those of others.
